# Live Clock Website

A simple and responsive live clock website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock updates in real-time and displays the current time.

## Features
- Real-time clock with automatic updates every second.
- Clean and minimal user interface.
- Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the structure of the website.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic time updates and functionality.

## How It Works
1. The **JavaScript `Date()` object** is used to fetch the current time.
2. The **`setInterval()` function** ensures the clock updates every second.
3. The DOM is manipulated to display the updated time in the correct format.

## Future Enhancements
- Add options to toggle between 12-hour and 24-hour formats.
- Include a dark/light mode toggle.
- Display the current date alongside the time.
